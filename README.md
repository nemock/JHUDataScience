Code, data and notes from JHU Data Science program

Week1 Assignments resulted in 
	complete.R
	corr.R
	pollutantmean.R

I didn't check in the first passes at these files as they were way too clunky. The versions I did check in might still lack a bit of finesse and efficiency, but they all use basic R routines and require no additional libraries. As a first set of R coding assignments, that seems like the right way to do it.

Looking forward to Week 2, which I'll crank out ASAP so it doesn't interfere with my upcoming travel.
